#A introduction to basic audio encoding
There are many different kinds of audio codecs. The main ones I will go over are: `.wav` `.aac` `.mp3` `.wma`  `.opus` `.m4a` (apple lossless, alac) `.flac` .
There are two main groups based on the compression algorithm they implement. 
Audio storage has come a long way from the first phonograph, digital media has over-taken analogue.
However, with current advances in both encoding and playback, there is very little difference left.
The two major types of compression are lossy and lossless. As the names imply, with lossy compression you lose (theoretically imperceivable) data to save space.
With lossless, you save every bit of data you can while still using strong compression to save on storage space.

| Lossless  | Lossy |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `.m4a`(alac)  | `.mp3`  |
| `.flac`  | `.aac`  | 
| `.wav` * | `.opus` | 
|			| `.wma` |

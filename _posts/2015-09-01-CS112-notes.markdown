Eclipse IDE

----------------------------
drew a ladder, memory is a bunch of bytes...
H  <--- pointer to memory(for example an array)
H 
H

Google, Graphs (for maps.. )
	connection of nodes
	
I can't see
something about dog, new dog
pass by value vs pass by reference

Java passes by Value 
Object references are passed by value
a copy of the object being referenced is passed as a value

so does making it static "fix" this problem?
-------------
Linked Lists
Lisp, car cdr

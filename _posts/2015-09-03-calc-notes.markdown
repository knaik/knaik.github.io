Indefinite integrals
\\( \int f(x) dx = F(x) + c \\) no limits

Definite integral
\\( \int_a^b f(x) dx \quad = A_1 - A_2 \quad (signed) \; area \; under \; graph \\\
\int_a^a f(x) dx = 0 \quad \quad \int_a^b f(x) dx = \int_a^c f(x) dx + \int_c^b f(x) dx \\\ 
\int_a^b f(x) dx = - \int_b^a f(x) dx \\)

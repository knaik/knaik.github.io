#Day 2

Area under a curve could be anything, negative or positive
Area between two curves will always be positive

Even function has symmetry across y-axis
Odd function has symmetry across 	origin

even
\\( f(-x) = f(x) \\)

odd
\\( f(-x) = -f(x) \\)

6.1 problem 32
sketch region closed by 
\\( y = \frac{x}{x^2 + 1} \quad and \quad y = \frac{x}{5} \\)

We we integrate w/ respect to x axis because one function is always top and another is always bottom
we shouldn't with y because towards the top of the function, the outer function is it's own top and bottom

\\(top \quad - \quad bottom \quad \int_0^ \quad Area = 2 \int









#Day 1

Two midterms and one final
first is  integration
second is series
final is cumulative

Review

Indefinite integrals
\\( \int f(x) dx = F(x) + c \\) no limits

Definite integral
\\( \int_a^b f(x) dx \quad = A_1 - A_2 \quad (signed) \; area \; under \; graph \\\
\int_a^a f(x) dx = 0 \quad \quad \int_a^b f(x) dx = \int_a^c f(x) dx + \int_c^b f(x) dx \\\ 
\int_a^b f(x) dx = - \int_b^a f(x) dx \\)

A1 is area above x-axis (positive), A2 is area below x-axis (negative)

Fudamental Theorm of Calc

I.
\\( \int_a^b f(x) dx = F(x) |_a^b = F(b) - F(a) \\)

II.
\\( \frac{d}{dx} \int_a^x f(t) dt  = f(x) \\)

piece wise

(3,2) , (0,-1)

m= y2 - y1 = 2 - -1
		------------------ = 1
		x2 - x1 = 3 - 0

y - 2 = x - 3
y = x - 1

so x intercept is 1

(1,0)
triangle

\\( \frac{b h}{2} = \frac{3 * 2}{ 2} = 3 = positive \quad Area \\\
\frac{b h}{2} = (1 * 1) / 2 \\\
3 - .5 = 2.5 \\)

\\(y_1 = x - 1 \quad y_2 = -2x+8\\)

integration, need to split, negative doesn't matter
\\(\int_0^3 y_1(x) dx + \int_3^4y_2(x) dx = 1.5 + 1 = 2.5 \\)

diff									int

\\( (e^x)' = e^x \quad \quad \int e^x dx = e^x +c \\\
sinx' = cosx						\int cosx = sinx + c \\\
cosx = -sinx						sinx = -cosx  +c \\\
tanx = sec^2 x 					sec^2 x = tanx + c\\\
x^n ' = nx^{n-1}				x^n = x^n+1/n+1 + c \\\
lnx' = 1/x 						1/x  = ln|x| + c\\\
b^x ' = b^x ln(b) \\\
arctan x'  = 1 / 1 + x^2 \\\
chain \quad rule \\\
\frac{d}{dx} [f(u)] = f'(u) *  u' \\\
subsitution
\int f'(u) * u' du = f(u) + c\\\
\\)

\\(
1. \int x sqrt{x^2 +9} dx \\\
2. \int_2^7 \\)

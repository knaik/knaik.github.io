What is Cancer? A biased introduction to cancer biology
Shridar Ganesan, M.D., PhD

Cancer is a pathological state rather than a singular path taken by a cell. Generally too much growth isn't necessarily fatal, exg hyperplasia. The increase in growth along with failure to differentiate causes problems. 

Cell division requires a "nuclear launch code", a large amount of checkpoints and mechanisms.

Internal source of mutations, when replicating, is much larger than outside sources, like radiation. Ageing, prolifation rate, much more important when considering caner risk. Stochastic distribution. Early childhood also at risk beause of large amount of cell division. Cancer depends on microenvironments, very few cancer grow autonomously.

Diagnosis of cancer is independent of ideology of cancer. Targetting cancers with therapy is hard. Signal equilibrium is central to specific cancers. Cancers often have very specific pathways, so by blocking it we can target cancer. We have redundant mechanisms for all major biological functions and so there is no overall loss of function.

Classification was by anatomy and histology. This if flawed because it doesn't reflect genetic characteristics. We are at the stage of doing genetic analysis to see if there are alternative treatements.

What is Medicinal Chemistry?
S. David Kimball, PhD

Drug analysis of Cdk2, Aminothiazole.

Bridge between chemistry and biology.

Drug-linkenss is an Emergent Property, small moleculare (membrane permeable), minimal amide and hydrgen bonds (oral bioavailability), metabolically stable.

Not purely analytical, more than simple form for new drug discovery.

The crystal structure of BMS-231830 illustrates the binding of the aminothiazoles in the ATP pocket of cdk2.  The matching HBD donor-acceptor pairs to Leu 83 have been observed in all subsequent structures. 

Potency is a siren song, becoming more potent, may be caused by nonspecific binding which is generally toxic.

Intuitive and creative solution for drug modification rather than computational.

Multi-dimensional optimization. Purely computationl technique does not work because unexpected interactions may occur. Toxicity is the focus for most drug research analysis.

Kinase Inhibitor Lead Discovery
John S. Tokarski

Insulin receptor Kinase.

Kinase structure is very good for small drug targetting.

#Day 1

Noncumulative final

Analysis = Approximate solutions, and error analysis
Goal is to find fastest/most efficient method.

Errors: modeling (engineering/physics/bio), approximation, arithmetic (representation)

Spline = same derivative from both sides, used in smoothing polygons, anti-aliasing?

Matlab = column storage of 2d array, Java/C = row storage

Q: Any regression methods?

Ch 7 is Least squares, patterns

Dimensional Reduction?

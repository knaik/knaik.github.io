#Google.

This post is 110% conjecture. Based on previous experiences and some intuitive guessing.

This new search algorithm based on artifical neural networks is horrible. It is getting the classication very wrong. This isn't the first time it happened. It keeps assuming what I meant rather than understand what I mean. Before I typed in "Child protecting adult" because I wanted a picture of a child acting like a hero. This is an ambiguous case for artifical intelligence but I know and you know very easily what that means. The ordering of the words matter. The AI search algorithm is throwing it away. Please stop.

Clearly I am researching Man In Distress. Not Man || Distress || Psychology. This is very inefficient. Please. 

Also are you using previous search results as a way to narrow the field? Because that's causing overfitting. The search results aren't related to each other but maybe the search engine thinks they are. Please stop. I was good at finding information through google, is there an older algorithm without the AI that I can use?

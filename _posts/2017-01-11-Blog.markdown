#I am going to write more and I'm planning on being more open about my opinion. Please take everything you read with a grain of salt. I am only a person with the same information as you. Many posts will be conjecture, but that's what a blog is supposed to be. I will try to include Sources.

My goal is to be as unbaised as but to be bias is human. Be critical.

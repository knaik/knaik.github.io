#Election as of 11:08

I will be summarizing the questions and responses in the most unbiased way possible.

Live blogging the Presidential 

Press Secretary has denied all claims put forth by buzzfeed and essentially called it irresponsible journalism.

Pence is accusing Mass Media of manipulating the public.

Trump is implying Intelligence agencies had a part to play in the article put forward by buzzfeed.

Trump is focusing in veterans, and aid for veterans.

Questions: Did the heads of intelligence agencies provide the 2 page summaries? Do you accept that Russia hacked DNC and RNC.

Trump: Information should not have been let out, because it's classified. Trump says he thinks it was Russia but then says it's all fake news. Trump will form a defense. Trump accuses DNC of having very weak security and says RNC was not able to be hacked because it did not have the same vulernabilites.

Trump: Hacking is bad, but look at what was learned from the hacking! ... What if Donald Trump had gotten the questions like Hillary did?

Question: What are your views on Russia?

Trump: I stand by what I said before. I tell my people to stay cautious. I will say that if Russia had something on me, wouldn't they have released it?

Question: Do you think the hacking was justified? Will you release your tax returns?

Trump: I have no dealings/loans with Russia. We could make deals, but I don't want to. Also no pending deals. I turned down a deal, because I stand by my conviction to not have any conflicts of interest. However, I would be able to do both. 

Question: Restating the question.

Trump: I became president so I don't believe people care about me releasing tax returns. 

Essentially Trump aruges that if people cared about the tax returns, they wouldn't have elected him. Since he is now elected, the Tax returns are no longer relevant. He doesn't explicity say he won't show his tax returns.


Trump is giving up control of his assets and will do things in his power to be sever his connections with his business. He is isolating himself from his businesses. Trump believes this way of separating himself from his businesses in order to, in his perspective, protect his assessets from becoming devalued because of scandals related to his presidency.

Trump is diverting foreign profits as charity to US Dept. of Treasury.

Question: Obamacare, what plans to replace?

Trump: Repeal and Replace. "It's a very complicated process." Obamacare is the Democrat's problem. 

Question: International Policies

Trump: In terms of new factories, any companies that plan to build factories outside of the US will have to deal with border taxes.

Question: Views on Intelligence Agencies.

Trump: We're going to start with the wall with Mexico. Mexico will reimburse us, that will happen. Maybe through taxes.

Trump accused Buzzfeed of being outright fake news.

Question: Do you trust US Intelligence?

Trump: Intelligence is very critcal. Withing 90 days, they will give me a report about being hacked. 

Question: You just said Russia had a part in hacking the DNC.

Trump: Everyone hacks the US.

Question: Message to Putin, Russia will have far greater respect for US.

Will you talk about botnets?

Authentication
Integrity
Nonrepudiation
Availability

Plaintext (cleartext) message P
Encryption E(p)
produces -> ciphertext c = e(p)
key
cipher

Restricted Cipher
secret algorithm
	Secrecy by obliqueness.obfuscation
	vulnerable to: leaking, reverse engineering

Shared Algorithms and secret keys
Bump key = physical locks

Kerckhoff's Principle (1883)
A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key is public knowledge
secret should rest entirely on the key

Good cryptosystem:
white noise, random noise


Brute Force
C = Ek(P)
P = Dk(C)
symmetric

Substitution
Caesr cipher
Shift cipher, simple variant, 
each letter replaced by one n positions aay modulo alphabet size. n = shift value = key
in Caesr's time key as 3. 

India - similar scheme
Pig latin

Last seen as ROT13 on Usenet to keep reader from seeing offensive messages unillingly

[U...T]

convey one piece of information for decrpytion: shift value
trivially easy to crack.

Polyalphabetic substitution ciphers

Multiple substituion,
Leon Battista Alberti: 1466: invented key

two disks
encrypt and decrypt

simple cipher, two rings, initial position is known

the second part of cipher is rotated to a new alignment

Vigenere polyalphabetic cipher
Use table and key ord to encpher a message, repeat keywoard over text: eg key = FACE

Matrix

Determine key length, count coincidences - identical characters n characters apart. find high values of n - that tells you the period of the key

Determine values f each character of the key, you know the length of they key - that's the # of Caesar ciphers you have
do a feq analysis of each position

One-time pads
Invented in 1917

each key letter on the pad encrypts exactly one plaintext character 
encryption is addition of characters modulo 26, 
sender destroys pages that have been used
reciever maintains an identical pad.

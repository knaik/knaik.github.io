Cryptography

Authentication
Integrity
Nonrepudiation
Availability

Plaintext (cleartext) message P
Encryption E(p)
produces -> ciphertext c = e(p)
key
cipher

Restricted Cipher
secret algorithm
	Secrecy by obliqueness.obfuscation
	vulnerable to: leaking, reverse engineering

Shared Algorithms and secret keys
Bump key = physical locks

Kerckhoff's Principle (1883)
A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key is public knowledge
secret should rest entirely on the key

Good cryptosystem:
white noise, random noise


Brute Force
C = Ek(P)
P = Dk(C)
symmetric

Substitution
Caesr cipher
Shift cipher, simple variant, 
each letter replaced by one n positions aay modulo alphabet size. n = shift value = key
in Caesr's time key as 3. 

India - similar scheme
Pig latin

Last seen as ROT13 on Usenet to keep reader from seeing offensive messages unillingly


pair
[A...Z]
[U...T]
My cat has fleas, gswunbmufzyum

convey one piece of information for decrpytion: shift value
trivially easy to crack.

ATBASH

Monoalphabetic subsitution cipher


problem(key)

Easy to decode
